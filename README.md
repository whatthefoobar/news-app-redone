# news-app-redone
In progress... Come back to see it done.

To Do:
- finish UI (ongoing, almost done)
- create node backend and store api key (Done)
- fetch data from the fontend and fill in all news sections with data from our api (Done)
- fix header lines on fullscreen (too short)
- create search news functionality
    - create backend endpoint to fetch from
    - create page for rendering search results on frontend
    - enable routes for frontend (react-router-dom)
- fill in headerbar news cattegory tabs
    - create api backend endpoint to fetch from (1 for all categories as we pass category in when we call it in frontend)
    - create page for each headerbar category tab, add it to our frontend router
- publish to render (build the frontend and serve it from the backend, so publish as a web service) <= will this work with api data ?
 
Done so far:
- the navbar
- news sections
Redoing the design and logic of an old news app project:
